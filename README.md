# String_methods
Assignment given on the Jitu training on Array Methods

## palindrome.js

1. A string is a palindrome if it is read the same from forward or backward. For example, dad reads the same either from forward or backward. So the word dad is a palindrome. Similarly, madam is also a palindrome. Write a JavaScript function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome.

## anagram.js

2. Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

## blank.js

3. Write a JavaScript function to check whether a string is blank or not.

## hide_email.js
4. Write a JavaScript function that hides email addresses to prevent unauthorized access.

 Test Data:
 ```js
 console.log(hide_email("robin_singh@example.com"));
 ```

 Output:
 ```bash
 robin...@example.com
 ```

## reverse.js

5. Write a JavaScript function to reverse words in a given string.

Test Data:
```js
const str1 = "abc";
const str2 = "JavaScript Exercises";

console.log(reverseWords(str1)); 
console.log(reverseWords(str2)); 
```

Output:
```bash
cba
sesicrexE tpircSavaJ
```
